# CSEA
A novel network core structure extraction algorithm utilized variational autoencoder for community detection.

### We have currently completed the test website for the CSEA algorithm. URL: http://39.99.195.136:8081/. ###

## Website Instruction

Please follow the content in Website_Instruction.pdf

## Datasets

The network datasets are available at: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/, https://linqs.org/datasets/ and http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html.

## Comparison Algorithms

The code for FN, KL, GN, LE, LPA, CNM, FUA and Infomap are implemented by built-in algorithms in the python packages named netwrokx or igraph. https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html and https://github.com/igraph/igraph.

The code for NMF, SC and PCA are implemented by in a python package named sklearn. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.

The code for Deepwalk and Node2vec are available at: https://github.com/shenweichen/GraphEmbedding.
