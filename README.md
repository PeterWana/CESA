# CSEA
A novel network core structure extraction algorithm utilized variational autoencoder for community detection.

The test website of CSEA algorithm is provided here. This website will be completed and be available by 2022.09.11.

### Datasets

The network datasets are available at: http://wwwpersonal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/, https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data and http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html.

### Comparison algorithms

The code for FN, KL, GN, LE, LPA, CNM, FUA and Infomap are implemented by built-in algorithms in the python packages named netwrokx and igraph. https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html or https://github.com/igraph/igraph.

The code for NMF, SC and PCA are implemented by in a python package named sklearn. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.

The code for Deepwalk and Node2vec are available at: https://github.com/shenweichen/GraphEmbedding.
